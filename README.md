Technical exercise – Spring Boot API managing clients and contracts

# User Stories
As a customer advisor, I want to create, view and update a client (Person or Company) so that I can manage their profile.
                      ** - delete a client so that all their contracts are closed on today’s date.**
                      ** - create a contract and update its amount so that the billing is accurate.**
                      ** - list active contracts and get their total so that I can track the client’s current portfolio.**
